# mozquic_example
This is going to be a simple client-server implementation using the QUIC-protocol as transport protocol. 

This example uses the mozquic-library as base. The used version can be found [here](https://github.com/jakobod/mozquic) in the 'trunk' branch.
It is a fork of https://github.com/mcmanus/mozquic, but slightly changed. 

# NOTE
This project needs to be compiled with clang/clang++. Otherwise you will probably get runtime errors.
