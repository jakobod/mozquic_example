# mozquic_example

This is going to be a simple client-server implementation using the QUIC-protocol as transport protocol. 

This example uses the mozquic-library as base. The used version can be found [here](https://github.com/jakobod/mozquic).
It is a fork of https://github.com/mcmanus/mozquic, but slightly changed.
